![error](./assets/failure.png)

> CloudWatch Logs role ARN must be set in account settings to enable logging.

In this case, You should configure IAM Role for logging.

Follow below two steps in [this document](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/api-gateway-cloudwatch-logs/):

- "Create an IAM role for logging to CloudWatch" section
- "Add the IAM role in the API Gateway console"

> NOTE: "Enable logging for your API and stage" section is not required.
